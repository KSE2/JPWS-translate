The function you chose allows to export password records in <U>cleartext
form</U> to a <U>CSV encoded textfile</U>. The purpose of this might be to 
generate a common persistent form of your database, which can be 
imported by other password applications or spreadsheet programs.

<P><FONT COLOR="#9400D3"><B>The result of this operation constitutes, however, a security breach for your password privateness!</B></FONT> The cleartext output can be read by everybody who obtains access to your computer or the data medium where you store it. Moreover, normal erasing of such a file is not enough to securely remove password data from the sight of inspectors.

<P>You should think therefore very carefully about necessity and consequences of your actions before proceeding to create a CSV output file! <FONT COLOR="#9400D3"><B>We recommend to perform this only if there is absolutely no other way to deal with your task or problem.</B></FONT> You may also benefit from the "<B>Secure File Wipe</B>" tool available in <I>JPasswords<I>.
