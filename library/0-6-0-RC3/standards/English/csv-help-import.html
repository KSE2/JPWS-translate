CSV Import reads password entries from a formatted text file and attempts to integrate them into an open database (merge) or create a new database, depending on the command you issued. Input files may conform to one of two format patterns, named <b>"DATABASE"</b> or <b>"SPREADSHEET"</b>. Independently thereof, a suitable character set can be chosen to meet existing encoding of the input file.

<table cellpadding="6">

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Target File</font></b></td>
<td>Options: Database in the work shelf.
<P>You can specify the database to receive the import. This is for convenience in case there are more than one files open in the program's desktop. 
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Target Group</font></b></td>
<td>Options: New or existing database folder.
<P>You can specify a particular database folder (group name) which will contain all imported password records. The value entered here works as a prefix to the group values of the imported entries. Choose "Root Directory" if you don't want any group prefix. (Note: Setting up a target group does not prevent record conflicts!)
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Text Format</font></b></td>
<td>Options: <b><small>DATABASE</small></b> and <b><small>SPREADSHEET</small></b>. 
<P><I>JPasswords</I> expects input conforming to <b>RFC-4180</b> (which is the foundation of IANA registered <B>MIME type "text/csv"</B>) for files of the "<U><B><small>DATABASE<small></B></U>" type. This format allows the most accurate representation of entry content. 

<P><I>JPasswords</I> implements a variant format (with semicolon field separator) by  format type "<U><B><small>SPREADSHEET</small></B></U>". If your input comes from a  calculation table application, or a corresponding output, use this option. It is, however, generally not possible to transport line-feeds as part of a field content (e.g. multi-line text fields).
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Character Set</font></b></td>
<td>Options: List of available character sets of your Java Virtual Machine. 
<P>Choose the most suitable standard depending on the encoding which was used to create your input file. "<U><B>UTF-8</B></U>" is a general good guess for all languages and environments. Users of the Western hemisphere might alternately wish to choose "<U><B>windows-1252</B></U>" or "<U><B>ISO-8859-1</B></U>".

<i>JPasswords</i> can read <b><i>KeePass</i></b> CSV export files. The proper option settings for this purpose are: DATABASE, UTF-8. 

<H3><font color="#005FBF">About CSV</font></H3>

CSV is often read as "comma separated values" and is a widely and loosely used text format to transport and even operationally store databases which are built on a record or table structure. Despite its popularity, there is no prescriptive standard defined for this format or any of the content data types. In consequence problems can arise when attempting to import CSV files from other applications. 

<H3><font color="#005FBF">Security Considerations</font></H3>

CSV files make your passwords visible in cleartext and hence are ditrimental to the purpose of <i>JPasswords</i> to keep your passwords protected. Try to avoid making copies of such files because every copy, even after it is "deleted" by your file manager, continues to constitute a security threat for you. Erase CSV files and any copies as soon as possible with the "<B>Secure File Wipe</B>" utility which is offered in <i>JPasswords'</i> Help menu.
